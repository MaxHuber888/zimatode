# Zimatode

**Zimatode** is a Python-based music visualizer that creates dynamic, physics-driven simulations in response to audio. Designed with simplicity and creativity in mind, the tool is currently under development with multiple simulations already implemented and more in the pipeline. The goal is to expand Zimatode into a fully-fledged tool for easily creating music visualizer videos, allowing users to generate visually captivating content synced to their music.

## Features

- **Multiple Simulations**: Zimatode includes various physics-based simulations that react to audio in real-time. Each simulation is customizable, offering different visual styles and behaviors based on the audio input.
  
- **Audio Analysis**: Powered by [librosa](https://librosa.org/), Zimatode analyzes the input audio to detect key features such as beats, rhythm, and spectral changes, which drive the visual effects.

- **Real-Time Visuals**: Built with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/), Zimatode renders visuals in real-time, making it easy to see how your audio tracks influence the simulations.

- **Customizability**: Users can tweak various parameters of the simulations and audio responses, providing flexibility for different visual styles and moods.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language for Zimatode’s development.
- **Pygame**: Used to create the simulations and render graphics.
- **Librosa**: Used for analyzing audio signals and extracting relevant data such as beats and spectral content.

## Future Work

- **Additional Simulations**: I’m continuing to develop new types of simulations to expand the creative possibilities.
- **Export Options**: In future updates, I aim to add video export options, enabling users to save and share their music visualizer creations easily.
- **Enhanced Customization**: More control over the visual elements, including colors, patterns, and audio response behaviors.
